This library is used by a bundle called `admin-publish-transfer`.

It is an app-specific bundle and these files should be moved to that apps repository.

However for time pressure the library files were not moved when the bundle was moved.

You should not use this library from oskari-frontend/libraries as we are working on removing these in favor of using npm installable dependencies.
